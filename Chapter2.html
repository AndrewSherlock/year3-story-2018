This mans name is karlston, a name that his notorious in the town as one who has been causing trouble. He has used extortion, gambling on sports that has been fixed to gain power and wealth in the town. Little did he know that the same person was controlling people with his wealth.

            <b><i>"This is a man that needs to be dealt with soon"</i></b> kasso taught to himself. Now in the seedy district of town, he feels a certain tension in the air as he feels the eyes of the gangs hit him. <i>"A trader is always dealing with underground characters"</i> spring into his mind as his put his hand on the hilt of his sword ready to attack.

            As the streets pass, he notices the neon lights of the loansharks office hit him. Knocking on the door, a thug meets him, asking what he wants in some uncolourful language. <i>"Im here to talk business with Karlston. He will be very interested in a little proposition i have for him."</i>, Kasso says in a attempt to bluff, knowing that failure would lead to more then not meeting the boss.

            With that a man comes in who stinks of all the underworld and explotation of the people of the town. <i>"Ohhhhh, if its a chance to make more money, im all in, but why would a trader like you deal with me"</i>, the man asked. As soon as he finishes talking, kasso understands that this is the boss that he wanted to meet to put an end to. Also this man knows of kasso and his trading company, this is very bad for kasso as the wool can no longer be pulled over the eyes. <i>"I'm right, you wanted to destroy my business dont yaaaa."</i>, screams Karlston. "Boys geddd him" as kasso retreats back readying himself for battle.

            <i>"Why dont you just let the people go? They cannot live under your rules and are good people."</i>, Kasso protests. "Ohhh people are good and decent, that'd dont matter much to me, how is that to line my pockets. They all act good and decent but they really would be me if they got half the chance." Kasso knows now that it doesnt matter what he says, he will have to fight for the people.
