        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        
        <p>
            In the world of (insert world name), there is seven continents, each one is vastly different then the last. This is the story of 
            a lone trader in the world of Treefall, a predominately wooded land which is one with nature. This is the story of how Kasso and the
            start of his journey to each of the continents.

            <i>"ahhhh man, this is exhausting, ara"</i> said Kasso to his pet gliding fox, a fox like flying squirrel. With that a scream comes from deep within
            the cave. Kasso threw down the axe he was using to run to check where the scream came from and if someone needed his help.

            He shouts out "who is there?? Are you ok", to no reply. To his horror he sees a dwarf attacking a young man, about his age. However people who are not used to the caves shout not be in them. Kasso grabs a rock that was resting at his feet, without thinking throwing the rock at the dwarfs head.

            The next thing he knew, he was in a battle against the dwarf, flinging his sword at it. A moment of genius came to kasso as he swung and hit a bit pile of gravel, blinding the evil creature. Wasting no time, kasso pierced into the dwarf putting an end to the battle.

            "Are you ok?", he asked the young man who was standing there with a shocked face on him. <i>"y-y-yes, thanks so much for helping me. I taught w-w-was done for there"</i>, the young man replied. Kasso decides that he should call it a day and escort the man back to his house to make sure that he arrives home ok.

            On arrival back into town, a loud shout comes from the slum district, <i>"<b>PAAAAAPAAAA</b>, Your home!!"</i>. It is the young mans son who was waiting for days for him to come home. Kasso and the man walk into his house. The mans name is stephen, he tells kasso that the slum district is ran by a man who keeps everyone in debt to control them. The man was in the cave looking for sakarite, a valuable substance to break free from the loan sharks grip. The angry kasso tells the man that he will end the terror in this neighbourhood, he can not let this go anymore.
