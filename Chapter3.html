            A loud smash rings through the office, as the front window falls. Its Ara, Kasso's fateful pet comes in to offer help to Kasso.

            <i>"I'll give you one more chance, will you let the people go free"</i>, Kasso saids as he turns around. But he is greeted with the boss with a crossbow pointing at him. <i>"You were soooo close, you may have had me but i was ready."</i>, Karlston brags. <i>"I have no reason to let the people go. <b>I HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL</b>"</i>. With that a molotiv cocktail flys through the window hitting the back wall.

            <b><i>"Your finished in this town Karlston, we are putting an end to this!!"</i></b> To Kasso's surprise, its the town people and leading them is stephen. <i>"Why is he here"</i>, Kasso thinks. Karlston is dragged out by the mobbe with the town elders behind them. They cuff Karlston and demand he either leaves town and never come back or be thrown into the sea.

            Stephen approaches Kasso. <i>"Thank you, you moved us into action. The people saw your efforts and came to me to help you. They believed in themselves because you pushed them. Now we can live in this town and make sure the weak have a voice."</i> Kasso taught to himself that he was not needed after all and felt relieve that the people stood together and fought.
