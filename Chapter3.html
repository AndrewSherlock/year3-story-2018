            A loud smash rings through the office, as the front window falls. Its Ara, Kasso's fateful pet comes in to offer help to Kasso. Immediately, Ara strikes and scratches two of the thugs in the eye. Meanwhile, Kasso kicks one of the thug out the empty space where there used to be a window. With that the tables are turned and its just Kasso and the boss left.

            <i>"I'll give you one more chance, will you let the people go free"</i>, Kasso saids as he turns around. But he is greeted with the boss with a crossbow pointing at him. <i>"You were soooo close, you may have had me but i was ready."</i>, Karlston brags. <i>"I have no reason to let the people go. <b>I HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL</b>"</i>.

        <p>
            The boss shot Kasso with the crossbow in the leg. Limping around knowing that this could be a losing battle, he was conflicted. <i>"Do i jump out and leave or do i stay and fight, <b>ARRRRRRRRRGH</b>. Either way this ends badly"</i>. With that kasso decided to retreat for now. The battle was lost but next time he will get him. He will just need to work harder

            This will be the start of a long journey for Kasso to improve and travel the seven continents of the world...
